            <h1 style="color: brown;">What is the future of e-learning?</h1><br><br>
            <p>E-learning is here to stay. As computer ownership grows across the globe e-learning becomes increasingly
                viable and accessible. <br><br> Internet connection speeds are increasing, and with that,<br><br>
                opportunities for more
                multimedia training methods arise.

                With the immense improvement of mobile networks in the past few years and the increase in telecommuting,
                <br><br>
                taking all the awesome features of e-learning on the road is a reality with smartphones and other
                portable devices. Technologies such as social media are also transforming education constantly.</p>
            
            <img src="a.jpg" alt="" width="90%"><br><br>
            <p>
                Generally speaking, learning is expensive, takes a long time and the results can vary. <br> E-learning has
                been trying for years now to complement the way we learn to make it more effective and measurable. The
                result now is that there are a number of tools that help create interactive training courses,<br>
                standardize the learning process and/or inject informal elements to otherwise formal learning processes.
                Several e-learning trends can give us a clear view of the future of e-learning and how learning tools
                will be <br><br>

                Micro-learning focuses on the design of micro-learning activities through micro-steps in digital media
                environments, which already is a daily reality for today’s knowledge workers. These activities can be
                incorporated into a learner’s daily routines. Unlike “traditional” e-learning approaches,<br> micro-learning
                often tends towards push technology through push media, which reduces the cognitive load on the
                learners. Therefore, the selection of micro-learning objects and also pace and timing of micro-learning
                activities are of importance for didactical <br><br><designs class="br"></designs> Micro-learning is an important paradigm shift that
                avoids the need to have separate learning sessions since the learning process is embedded in the daily
                routine of the end-user. It is also perfectly suited for mobile devices where long courses can be
                overkill.
                Gamification is the use of game thinking and game mechanics in a non-game context to engage users and
                solve <br>

                Personalized Learning is the tailoring of pedagogy, curriculum and learning environments to meet the
                needs and aspirations of individual learners. Personalization is broader than just individualization or
                differentiation in that it affords the learner a degree of choice about what is learned, when it is
                learned and how it is learned. This may not indicate unlimited choice since learners will still have
                targets to be met. <br><br> However, it may provide learners the opportunity to learn in ways that suit their
                individual learning styles and multiple intelligences. <br><br>

                The distant future of eLearning: Automatic learning
                In a well-known scene from the movie The Matrix, Neo lies down in a high-tech dentist’s chair and straps
                on a wild array of electrodes, downloading a series of martial arts training programs into his brain. <br><br>
                Afterward, he opens his eyes and speaks the words geeks have been quoting ever since: “I know Kung Fu.” <br><br>

                This type of automatic learning might sound like a dystopian future for many but it is where we are
                heading. And despite the ethical questions that may arise, the benefits could be substantial at multiple
                levels if used properly. Here’s how it works: <br><br> you pick a task that requires high performance from your
                visual cortex such as catching a ball. Then you go find someone who’s a pro at catching a ball, place
                them in an fMRI machine and record what’s going on in their brain whilst they visualize catching a ball.
                Then you’ve got your ball-catching program, and you’re ready to learn. <br><br> Next step: put yourself into the
                fMRI machine, and rig it to induce that pro-ball-catching imagery that you recorded earlier in your
                brain using neurofeedback. You don’t even have to be paying attention while this is going on. Your
                brain, though, becomes familiar with that pattern – which is essentially what learning is: the brain
                becoming familiar with new patterns. <br><br>

                Research has shown that this fMRI pattern playback can cause long-lasting improvement in tasks that
                require visual performance. In theory, a type of automated learning is a potential outcome and what
                e-learning in the distant future may look like. <br><br>
